# Chapter 1: Introduction to Python and Setting Up Your Environment 🐍

Welcome to the exciting world of Python! This chapter will guide you through the very basics, setting you up for a fantastic coding journey.

## 1.1: What is Python? 🤔

Imagine a language that's as easy to read as English but powerful enough to build almost anything – that's Python! Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, Python was designed for readability.

**Why Python is awesome:**

*   **Beginner-Friendly:** Simple syntax makes it easy to learn.
*   **Versatile:** Used in web development, data science, machine learning, scripting, and more.
*   **Huge Community:** Massive online support and libraries available.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Think of Python as the Swiss Army knife of programming languages. Need to automate a task? Python. Want to analyze data? Python. Building a website? Python can do that too!

## 1.2: Setting up Your Development Environment 🛠️

Time to get your hands dirty! Let's install Python and a code editor.

**1. Installing Python:**

*   **Windows:** Download the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Remember to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation!
*   **macOS:** Python often comes pre-installed, but it's best to download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).
*   **Linux:** Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install python3` on Ubuntu/Debian).

**2. Choosing a Code Editor:**

A code editor is where you'll write and run your Python code. Here are a few popular options:

*   **VS Code:** A powerful, free editor with excellent Python support (install the Python extension).
*   **Thonny:** A simple editor specifically designed for beginners.
*   **IDLE:** Comes with Python, a very basic editor.

For this course, we recommend VS Code or Thonny.

**3. Setting up the Python Interpreter:**

Your code editor needs to know where Python is installed. VS Code usually detects it automatically. If not, you may need to configure the Python interpreter path in your editor's settings.

## 1.3: Your First Python Program 🚀

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program. Open your code editor and create a new file named `hello.py`.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file. Now, run it! In VS Code, you can right-click in the editor and choose "Run Python File in Terminal." In Thonny, just click the "Run" button. You should see "Hello, World!" printed in the terminal.

**Understanding the syntax:**

*   `print()` is a built-in function that displays output to the console.
*   `"Hello, World!"` is a string – a sequence of characters.

## 1.4: Variables and Data Types 🧮

Variables are like containers that store data. Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold.

```python
age = 30  # Integer (whole number)
price = 99.99 # Float (decimal number)
name = "Alice" # String (text)
is_student = True # Boolean (True or False)

print(age)
print(price)
print(name)
print(is_student)
```

**Basic Arithmetic Operations:**

```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x - y)  # Subtraction
print(x * y)  # Multiplication
print(x / y)  # Division
```

## 1.5: Input and Output ⌨️

Let's make our program interactive!

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

age = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age) # Convert string to integer

print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.") # Convert integer to string
```

**Explanation:**

*   `input()` prompts the user to enter text. It always returns a string.
*   `int()` converts a string to an integer.
*   `str()` converts a number to a string.

**Important Note:** Always validate user input to prevent errors!

**Your Task for the Next 24 Hours:**

Write a program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite color. Then, print a personalized message using that information.

Example:

```
What is your name? Bob
How old are you? 25
What is your favorite color? Blue
Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old and your favorite color is Blue.
```

This is just the beginning. Keep exploring, keep coding, and get ready for the next chapter! 🎉


## Chapter 2: Control Flow and Functions

Welcome back, future Pythonistas! In this chapter, we're going to unlock the power of decision-making and code organization. Get ready to control the flow of your programs and write reusable blocks of code. Let's dive in! 🚀

### Section 2.1: Conditional Statements

**Why?** Imagine your program is a GPS. It needs to make decisions based on different routes. Conditional statements allow your code to execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are true or false.

**What?** The primary conditional statement is the `if` statement. You can extend it with `elif` (else if) and `else` to handle multiple possibilities.

**How?**

```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")
```

**When?** Use `if` statements whenever you need your program to make choices.  For example, checking if a user is logged in, validating input, or determining which action to take.

*   **Comparison Operators:** `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to).
*   **Logical Operators:** `and` (both conditions must be true), `or` (at least one condition must be true), `not` (reverses the condition).

**Example:**
```python
temperature = 25
is_raining = True

if temperature > 20 and not is_raining:
    print("It's a pleasant day.")
else:
    print("It's not a pleasant day.")
```

### Section 2.2: Loops

**Why?**  Repetition is key. Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, saving you from writing the same code over and over.

**What?** Python offers two main types of loops: `for` and `while`.

**How?**

*   **`for` loop:** Iterates over a sequence (like a string, list, or range).

    ```python
    for i in range(5):  # range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4
        print(i)
    ```

*   **`while` loop:** Repeats as long as a condition is true.

    ```python
    count = 0
    while count < 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1 # Important: Increment count to avoid infinite loop!
    ```

*   **`break` and `continue`:**
    *   `break`: Exits the loop immediately.
    *   `continue`: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next.

    ```python
    for i in range(10):
        if i == 5:
            break  # Exit the loop when i is 5
        if i % 2 == 0:
            continue # Skip even numbers
        print(i) #output: 1, 3
    ```

**When?** Use `for` loops when you know how many times you need to iterate. Use `while` loops when you need to repeat code until a certain condition is met.

### Section 2.3: Functions

**Why?** Imagine building with Lego. Functions are like pre-built Lego blocks. They allow you to encapsulate a specific task into a reusable unit.

**What?** Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.

**How?**

```python
def greet(name):
    """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter.""" #Docstring explaining the function
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")  # Calling the function
```

*   **Parameters:** Inputs to the function (e.g., `name` in the example above).
*   **Return Values:** Functions can return a value using the `return` statement.

    ```python
    def add(x, y):
        """This function returns the sum of x and y."""
        return x + y

    result = add(5, 3)
    print(result)  # Output: 8
    ```

*   **Scope:** Variables defined inside a function are local to that function.

**When?** Use functions to break down your code into smaller, manageable, and reusable pieces.

### Section 2.4: String Manipulation

**Why?** Strings are everywhere! Manipulating them is a fundamental skill.

**What?** Python provides powerful tools for working with strings.

**How?**

*   **Slicing:** Extract a portion of a string.

    ```python
    text = "Python"
    print(text[0:3])  # Output: Pyt
    ```

*   **Concatenation:** Combine strings.

    ```python
    first_name = "John"
    last_name = "Doe"
    full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
    print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe
    ```

*   **Common Methods:**
    *   `upper()`: Converts to uppercase.
    *   `lower()`: Converts to lowercase.
    *   `strip()`: Removes leading/trailing whitespace.
    *   `find()`: Finds the index of a substring.
    *   `replace()`: Replaces a substring with another.

    ```python
    text = "  Hello, World!  "
    print(text.strip().upper())  # Output: HELLO, WORLD!
    ```

**When?** Use string manipulation whenever you need to process or format text data.

**Challenge:** Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the number of words in the sentence.

You've now learned how to control the flow of your programs and create reusable code blocks. In the next chapter, we'll put these skills to the test by building your first project: a number-guessing game! 🥳


## Chapter 3: Building Your First Project: A Simple Number Guessing Game 🎮

Welcome to the final chapter! Get ready to put your Python skills to the test by building a fun and interactive Number Guessing Game. This project will solidify your understanding of variables, data types, control flow, and functions. Let's dive in!

### Section 3.1: Project Overview: Number Guessing Game 🎯

The Number Guessing Game is a classic! The computer selects a random number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The player continues guessing until they guess the correct number or run out of attempts.

Here's the breakdown of how we'll build it:

1.  **Generate a Random Number:** The computer secretly picks a number.
2.  **Get User Input:** Ask the player to guess a number.
3.  **Validate Input:** Make sure the player enters a valid number.
4.  **Compare Guess:** Check if the player's guess matches the secret number.
5.  **Provide Feedback:** Tell the player if their guess is too high or too low.
6.  **Track Guesses:** Count how many attempts the player has made.
7.  **Game Over:** End the game when the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.

### Section 3.2: Generating a Random Number 🎲

Python's `random` module comes to the rescue! This module provides functions for generating random numbers.

```python
import random

# Generate a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
print(secret_number) #For testing only
```

**Explanation:**

*   `import random`: This line imports the `random` module, giving us access to its functions.
*   `random.randint(1, 100)`: This function generates a random integer between 1 and 100.  The `randint()` function includes both the start and end numbers in the possible random numbers.

### Section 3.3: Getting User Input and Validating It ⌨️

We need to get the player's guess and make sure it's a valid number.

```python
while True:
    try:
        guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
        if 1 <= guess <= 100:
            break  # Valid input, exit the loop
        else:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
```

**Explanation:**

*   `while True:`: This creates an infinite loop that continues until the user enters a valid number.
*   `input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: ")`: This prompts the user to enter a guess and stores it as a string.
*   `int()`: This attempts to convert the user's input to an integer.
*   `try...except ValueError:`: This handles the case where the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer (e.g., "abc").
*   `if 1 <= guess <= 100:`: This checks if the guess is within the valid range (1 to 100).
*   `break`: If the input is valid, the `break` statement exits the loop.
*   `else`: If the input is not valid, an error message is printed.

### Section 3.4: Implementing the Game Logic 🤔

Now, let's put it all together and implement the core game logic.

```python
import random

secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts_left = 7  # Allow 7 attempts

print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

while attempts_left > 0:
    try:
        guess = int(input(f"You have {attempts_left} attempts left. Guess the number: "))
        if 1 <= guess <= 100:
            if guess == secret_number:
                print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number {secret_number} in {7 - attempts_left + 1} attempts.")
                break
            elif guess < secret_number:
                print("Too low!")
            else:
                print("Too high!")
            attempts_left -= 1
        else:
            print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

if attempts_left == 0:
    print(f"You ran out of attempts. The number was {secret_number}.")
```

**Explanation:**

*   `attempts_left = 7`:  Sets the number of allowed attempts.
*   `while attempts_left > 0:`:  The game continues as long as the player has attempts left.
*   The code compares the `guess` with the `secret_number` and provides feedback.
*   `attempts_left -= 1`: Decrements the number of attempts after each guess.
*   If the loop finishes without a correct guess, the player loses, and the secret number is revealed.

### Section 3.5: Adding Features and Polishing the Game ✨

Here are some ideas to enhance your game:

*   **Difficulty Levels:** Allow the player to choose a difficulty level (e.g., easy, medium, hard) that changes the range of the random number and the number of attempts.
*   **Play Again:** Ask the player if they want to play again after the game ends.
*   **Comments:** Add comments to your code to explain what each part does. This makes your code easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Input Validation:** Add more robust input validation to handle edge cases.

Congratulations! You've built your first Python project. Take pride in your accomplishment and keep practicing to further develop your skills.

**Your 24-Hour Task:**

1.  Type the code for the Number Guessing Game into your code editor.
2.  Run the game and play it a few times.
3.  Add at least one of the "Adding Features and Polishing the Game" enhancements.

Happy coding! 🎉
