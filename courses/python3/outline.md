    *   **Channels:** Creating and Using Channels, Sending and Receiving Data, Synchronous and Asynchronous Channels.
    *   **Synchronization Primitives:** Mutexes, Read/Write Locks, Atomic Operations, Condition Variables.
    *   **Error Handling:** The `Result` Type, `panic!` and `catch_unwind`, Custom Error Types, Error Propagation.
    *   **Concurrency and Error Handling:** Handling Errors in Threads, Using `Result` with Channels, Preventing Deadlocks.
    *   **Practical Exercises:** Building a concurrent web server, implementing a parallel data processing pipeline, handling errors in a multi-threaded application.

**Chapter 3: Advanced Rust Concepts and System Programming**

*   **Key Learning Objectives:**
    *   Understand and utilize unsafe Rust for low-level operations.
    *   Work with raw pointers and foreign function interfaces (FFI).
    *   Implement custom allocators for memory management.
    *   Utilize macros for code generation and metaprogramming.

    *   **Custom Allocators:** Understanding Memory Allocation, Implementing a Custom Allocator, Using Custom Allocators in Rust.
    *   **Macros:** Declarative Macros (`macro_rules!`), Procedural Macros (Function-like, Derive, Attribute), Using Macros for Code Generation.
    *   **System Programming in Rust:** Interacting with the Operating System (File I/O, Networking, Process Management), Building Device Drivers (Introduction), Embedded Systems (Overview).
    *   **Practical Exercises:** Writing a system call wrapper, implementing a custom memory allocator, building a simple device driver, using macros to generate boilerplate code.

**Suggested Learning Progression:**

1.  **Chapter 1: Mastering Ownership and Borrowing:** This chapter is foundational. Students must thoroughly understand ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes before proceeding.
2.  **Chapter 2: Concurrency and Error Handling in Rust:** This chapter builds upon the ownership concepts and introduces concurrency primitives and error handling, allowing students to write more robust and reliable applications.
3.  **Chapter 3: Advanced Rust Concepts and System Programming:** This chapter covers advanced topics like unsafe Rust, FFI, custom allocators, and system programming. It is intended for students who want to delve deeper into Rust's capabilities and use it for low-level or specialized tasks.
