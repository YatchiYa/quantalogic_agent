## Code Style

We use `ruff` to enforce consistent code style and formatting. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Linting**: Run `ruff` to check for style issues:
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   ```
2. **Formatting**: Use `ruff` to format your code:
   ```bash
   ruff format .
   ```
3. **General Guidelines**:
   - Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code style.
   - Use type hints where applicable.
   - Keep functions and classes concise and focused.

## Testing

We use `pytest` for testing. Follow these steps:

1. **Write Tests**: Add tests for new features or bug fixes in the `tests/` directory.
2. **Run Tests**: Execute all tests using:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
3. **Test Coverage**: Ensure your changes maintain or improve test coverage. Check coverage with:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Branch Naming**: Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature X").
3. **Pull Request**:
   - Push your branch to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of the original repository.
   - Provide a detailed description of your changes, including the problem solved and the solution.
4. **Code Review**: Address any feedback from reviewers promptly. Ensure all tests pass and the code is linted before marking the PR as ready for review.
