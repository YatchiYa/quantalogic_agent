## How to Use This List

These combinations are generated using statistical analysis of historical Euromillions data, including:

- Frequency analysis of drawn numbers
- Recent trend analysis from the last 20 draws
- Distribution balance between low (1-25) and high (26-50) numbers
- Sum total optimization (optimal range: 95-155)
- Pattern analysis to avoid excessive consecutive numbers

Each combination is assigned a relative probability score based on these factors. While no prediction system can guarantee a win (as lottery draws are random), these combinations leverage statistical patterns that have historically been more successful.
