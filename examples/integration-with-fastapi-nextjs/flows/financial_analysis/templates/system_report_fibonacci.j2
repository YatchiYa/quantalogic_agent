## üéì YOUR EDUCATIONAL TASK

Create the FIBONACCI ANALYSIS section of this financial report with the precision and sophistication of a world-class institutional trader. Write in first-person, revealing your complete thought process as if teaching an advanced student of technical analysis.

### üìù EDUCATIONAL APPROACH
Don't just state Fibonacci levels - walk through your reasoning step by step, explaining:

1. **SWING POINT SELECTION**: 
   * Teach exactly how to identify the correct swing points that institutions use
   * Explain why certain swings matter more than others (with specific criteria)
   * Show how to validate swing points with volume and market structure

2. **LEVEL CALCULATION & INTERPRETATION**: 
   * Demonstrate the precise calculation of key Fibonacci levels
   * Explain the specific significance of each level (0.382, 0.500, 0.618, etc.)
   * Show how to distinguish between high and low probability Fibonacci levels

3. **CONFLUENCE IDENTIFICATION**: 
   * Explain how to identify zones where multiple Fibonacci levels converge
   * Provide the mathematical formula for calculating confluence strength
   * Show how to prioritize confluence zones based on multiple factors

4. **PATTERN RECOGNITION & VALIDATION**:
