## 🎓 YOUR EDUCATIONAL TASK

Create the MARKET CONTEXT section of this financial report with the precision and sophistication of a world-class institutional macro strategist. Write in first-person, revealing your complete thought process as if teaching an advanced student of global markets.

### 📝 EDUCATIONAL APPROACH
Don't just list market factors - walk through your reasoning step by step, explaining:

1. **WHAT TO MONITOR**: 
   * Teach exactly which macro indicators and relationships to track and why they matter
   * Explain the specific thresholds that signal regime changes (e.g., PMI below 48.5, yield curve inversion >25bps)
   * Show how to distinguish between noise and meaningful market signals

2. **HOW TO CONNECT DOTS**: 
   * Demonstrate how seemingly unrelated markets provide confirmation/divergence signals
   * Explain the transmission mechanisms between monetary policy, yields, currencies, and risk assets
   * Show how to build a coherent market narrative from disparate data points

3. **WHY IT MATTERS**: 
   * Explain how macro context determines appropriate trading strategies and risk parameters
   * Reveal how institutional positioning creates tradable opportunities
   * Connect current conditions to historical analogs with specific outcome probabilities

4. **WHEN TO SHIFT BIAS**: 
   * Specify precise thresholds for changing market views based on macro shifts
   * Detail exact confirmation signals across multiple timeframes and asset classes
   * Explain when macro factors should override technical signals (and vice versa)

### 📊 REQUIRED ANALYSIS COMPONENTS
Your market context analysis must be COMPREHENSIVE (800-1000 words), covering:

1. **CURRENT MACRO REGIME**: 
   * Precise identification of where we are in economic, credit, and market cycles
   * Monetary and fiscal policy positioning with forward implications
   * Inflation/deflation forces with transmission timeline

2. **INTERMARKET RELATIONSHIPS**: 
   * Key correlations between bonds, currencies, commodities, and equities
   * Confirmation or divergence signals across asset classes
   * Leading indicator identification with statistical validity

3. **LIQUIDITY LANDSCAPE**: 
   * Central bank balance sheet trends and implications
   * Market depth metrics across key instruments
   * Funding stress indicators with historical comparisons

4. **INSTITUTIONAL POSITIONING**: 
   * Smart money flow analysis across sectors and factors
   * Options positioning with put/call ratios and gamma exposure
   * Sentiment extremes with contrarian signal assessment

5. **HISTORICAL CONTEXT**: 
   * Similar historical market setups with outcome analysis
   * Statistical probability of various scenarios based on historical analogs
   * Unique factors that may invalidate historical comparisons

6. **ACTIONABLE IMPLICATIONS**: 
   * Specific trading strategies appropriate for the current macro regime
   * Risk management parameters based on volatility regime
   * Key signposts to watch for regime shifts

Use specific data points, comparative analysis, and historical parallels to ground your assessment in empirical reality rather than subjective opinion. Include specific examples that teach the reader how to apply these concepts themselves.
