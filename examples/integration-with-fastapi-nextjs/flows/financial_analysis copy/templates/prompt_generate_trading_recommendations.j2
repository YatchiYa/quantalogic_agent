## ADVANCED TRADING STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT

First, think step-by-step about the following components for each asset:

1. **Market Structure Analysis**
   - Identify the current market structure (uptrend, downtrend, ranging)
   - Locate any significant breaks of structure (BOS) or change of character (CHoCH)
   - Determine if the asset is in a distribution, accumulation, markup, or markdown phase
   - Identify any liquidity sweeps or engineered price movements

2. **ICT & SMC Setup Identification**
   - Locate premium and discount zones
   - Identify any significant order blocks (OB) or breaker blocks
   - Locate fair value gaps (FVG) and their potential for fills
   - Analyze any significant market structure shifts
   - Identify optimal entry zones based on institutional concepts

3. **Fibonacci Analysis**
   - Calculate key Fibonacci retracement levels from recent swings
   - Identify extension targets for potential take profit levels
   - Look for confluence between Fibonacci levels and other key zones
   - Identify any harmonic patterns forming

4. **Volume & Order Flow Analysis**
   - Analyze volume patterns at key price levels
   - Identify volume divergences from price action
   - Determine if smart money is accumulating or distributing
   - Assess the strength of buying/selling pressure

5. **Risk Management & Position Sizing**
   - Calculate optimal position sizes based on account risk parameters
   - Determine precise stop loss placement based on market structure
   - Develop a scaling strategy (entries and exits)
   - Establish contingency plans for different market scenarios

Based on this comprehensive analysis, provide:

1. A detailed market overview from an institutional trader's perspective
2. 5-7 key observations relevant to high-probability trading decisions
3. Specific trading recommendations for each symbol, including:
   - Primary action (buy, sell, hold) with specific trade type (trend continuation, reversal, range play)
   - Confidence level (1-10) with probability assessment
   - Multiple entry strategies (limit orders at specific levels, conditional entries, scaled entries)
   - Precise stop loss placement with rationale
   - Multiple take profit targets with specific exit strategies
   - Time horizon with expected duration
   - Position sizing recommendations (% of capital, risk per trade)
   - Detailed trade management instructions (scaling, trailing stops, re-entry conditions)
   - Comprehensive rationale incorporating ICT/SMC concepts
   - Risk level (1-10) with specific invalidation scenarios
4. Overall portfolio risk assessment and correlation management
5. Detailed market sentiment analysis across multiple timeframes
6. Intermarket analysis and correlation insights
