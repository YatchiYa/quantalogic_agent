- Trend Health: {{price_analysis.trend_health}}
- Momentum Score: {{price_analysis.momentum_score}}

Technical Indicators:
{% for indicator in technical_indicators %}
- {{indicator.name}}: {{indicator.value}} ({{indicator.signal}})
{% endfor %}

Market Structure:
- Structure Type: {{market_structure.structure_type}}
- Key Levels:
{% for level in market_structure.key_levels %}

{% for pattern in patterns %}
- {{pattern.name}} ({{pattern.type}}) - Reliability: {{pattern.reliability}}/10
{% endfor %}

Identify 2-3 advanced chart patterns or setups that may not have been captured by basic analysis. For each pattern:

1. Name: Specific pattern name
2. Type: Reversal, continuation, or complex
3. Reliability: Score from 1-10
4. Description: Detailed explanation of the pattern
5. Entry Points: Specific price levels for potential entries
6. Targets: Potential price targets
7. Stop Loss: Recommended stop loss level
8. Timeframes: Which timeframes this pattern is valid for
9. Confluence Factors: Other technical elements supporting this pattern

Focus on advanced patterns like:
- ICT concepts (breaker blocks, fair value gaps)
- Smart Money Concepts (liquidity grabs, order blocks)
- Wyckoff structures (accumulation, distribution)
- Harmonic patterns (Gartley, Butterfly)
- Complex Elliott Wave structures
- Market structure shifts

Your analysis should provide actionable insights beyond basic pattern recognition.
