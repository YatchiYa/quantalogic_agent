Develop a comprehensive risk scenario analysis that addresses the following aspects:

1. BASE CASE SCENARIO (at least 300 words)
   Describe the most likely scenario for {{ symbol }} based on the current analysis. What is the expected path forward? What factors support this scenario? What is the probability of this scenario playing out? What would be the expected price range and key milestones in this scenario?

2. BULLISH SCENARIO (at least 300 words)
   Describe a bullish scenario that could unfold. What catalysts would drive this scenario? What early warning signs would indicate this scenario is developing? What is the probability of this scenario? What would be the expected price range and key milestones in this scenario?

3. BEARISH SCENARIO (at least 300 words)
   Describe a bearish scenario that could unfold. What catalysts would drive this scenario? What early warning signs would indicate this scenario is developing? What is the probability of this scenario? What would be the expected price range and key milestones in this scenario?

4. BLACK SWAN EVENTS (at least 300 words)
   Identify potential black swan events that could significantly impact {{ symbol }}. These should be low-probability but high-impact events. For each event, describe the potential impact, warning signs, and risk mitigation strategies.

5. CORRELATION RISKS (at least 300 words)
   Analyze how {{ symbol }} might be affected by movements in correlated assets or broader market conditions. Identify potential correlation breakdowns or amplifications that could create unexpected risks or opportunities.

6. VOLATILITY SCENARIO ANALYSIS (at least 300 words)
   Analyze how different volatility regimes might affect {{ symbol }}. Consider scenarios of volatility expansion, contraction, and regime shifts. How would these different volatility environments impact trading strategies and risk management?

7. LIQUIDITY RISK ASSESSMENT (at least 300 words)
   Assess potential liquidity risks for {{ symbol }}. Consider scenarios where market liquidity could deteriorate and the potential impact on price action. Identify warning signs of liquidity problems and strategies to manage this risk.

8. POSITION SIZING AND RISK ALLOCATION (at least 300 words)
   Based on the risk scenarios, provide recommendations for position sizing and risk allocation. How should risk be managed across different scenarios? What position sizing methodology would be most appropriate given the current risk profile?

9. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES (at least 300 words)
   Develop specific risk mitigation strategies for each identified risk scenario. These should include hedging strategies, stop-loss methodologies, and portfolio adjustments that could protect against downside while preserving upside potential.

10. RISK MONITORING FRAMEWORK (at least 300 words)
    Create a framework for monitoring key risk indicators. What specific metrics, price levels, or conditions should be monitored to provide early warning of changing risk dynamics? How frequently should these indicators be assessed?
