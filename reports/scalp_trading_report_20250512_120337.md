## Market Analysis
Gold Futures Analysis (GC=F)

### Market Structure
Current Wyckoff Phase: Distribution. Key swing points are $3284.7 (previous high) and $3251.5 (recent low). Order blocks identified at $3286.5 - $3287.0, with fair value gaps at $3284.0 - $3284.5. The market is currently under distribution, with smart money looking to sell into strength, as evidenced by the price action and volume signature. Retail traders are typically chasing moves, which adds to liquidity for institutional players.

### Technical Analysis
The 1m timeframe shows a slight uptrend in the last few candles, but the overall context is bearish based on the higher timeframe (15m) where the market is in a markdown phase. The volume signature indicates declining participation, suggesting a lack of conviction in upward moves. The use of moving averages indicates a potential rejection at the MA9 level across multiple timeframes, reinforcing the bearish bias.

### Volume Analysis
Volume has been decreasing across all timeframes, signaling a lack of participation in the current upward momentum. The alerts for volume/price divergence suggest that price is not supported by volume, indicating a potential reversal or correction.

### Key Levels
Key levels include $3284.7 (strong resistance), $3286.5 - $3287.0 (order block), and $3251.5 (recent low). The fair value gap between $3284.0 and $3284.5 is crucial to monitor for potential reversals. Institutions typically have their stop-losses clustered just above resistance levels, around $3288.0 - $3290.0, where they may trigger liquidity for their entry or exit decisions.

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
The 15m timeframe shows a bearish trend, with the MA200 significantly above current price action, indicating room for further downside. The 5m timeframe shows oscillations around the MA20, suggesting potential scalping opportunities for quick profits. Alignment occurs when the 1m shows a reversal pattern near the key levels identified on the higher timeframes, providing high-probability setups for entries.

## Trading Recommendations
