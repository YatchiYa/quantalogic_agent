## Market Analysis
Current BTC-USD price is $104576.8203, showing a strong 24-hour change of 10.59%. The price has been in a bullish trend recently, with volatility increasing. The market is currently in a critical phase where support and resistance levels are being tested.

### Market Structure
The recent market structure shows higher highs and higher lows, indicating a bullish trend. However, the RSI on the 15m timeframe indicates a potential overbought condition (RSI at 40.67), which may lead to a short-term correction. Key swing points to watch are at $104300 (support) and $105000 (resistance).

### Technical Analysis
The price is currently at $104576.8203, above the 9-period and 20-period moving averages on the 15m chart, indicating bullish momentum. The Bollinger Bands suggest that the price is nearing the upper band ($105191.8), which may act as resistance. The ATR indicates volatility of $137.8477, suggesting that price movements can be significant within the next 1-4 hours.

### Volume Analysis
The recent volume has been increasing, particularly during price spikes at specific times (e.g., 04:30 and 04:45). This indicates that buyers are active and possibly pushing prices higher. However, the volume/price divergence is absent, suggesting that the current trend is supported by volume. Institutional activity is likely present, especially given the significant volume spikes.

### Key Levels
Immediate support is at $104300 and key resistance at $105000. If prices break above $105000, the next target could be $105300. Conversely, if they drop below $104300, they might test the $104000 mark next. Scalpers should look for entry points around these levels for quick trades.

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
On the 30m timeframe, the price is also showing bullish characteristics with strong volume. The RSI indicates potential overbought conditions (22.39). On the 1h timeframe, the price is showing a similar bullish structure, but a correction might occur soon due to the high RSI (73.22). This multi-timeframe analysis suggests that while the immediate trend is bullish, traders should be cautious of potential pullbacks.

## Trading Recommendations

### Market Outlook
