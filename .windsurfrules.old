## Python 3.12 Development Guide
.

### Python Version and Environment
- **Use Python 3.12**: Ensure that all developments are based on Python 3.12 to leverage the latest features and improvements.
- **Dependency Management with Poetry**: Always use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management to simplify package management and project configuration.
- **Isolated Environments**: Maintain isolated virtual environments for each project to avoid dependency conflicts and ensure reproducibility.

## Library Development

- pydantic v2: Use pydantic v2 for data models and validation.
- rich: Utilize rich for rich text formatting and styling.
- loguru: Utilize loguru for logging and structured logging.

### Project Configuration
- **Version Control**: Always include `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files in version control to track project dependencies accurately.
- **Project Settings**: Configure all project settings within `pyproject.toml`, including dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

### Dependency Management
- **Installing Dependencies**: Use the command:
  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```
- **Adding New Dependencies**: To add a new package, use:
  ```bash
  poetry add package_name
  ```
- **Updating Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up-to-date with:
  ```bash
  poetry update
  ```

### Code Quality and Linting
- **Linting and Formatting**: Use [Ruff](https://ruff.rs/) for linting and code formatting.
- **Run Lint Checks**: Execute lint checks with:
  ```bash
  poetry run ruff check .
  ```
- **Automatic Fixes**: Automatically fix linting issues using:
  ```bash
  poetry run ruff fix .
  ```
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate Ruff checks into your CI/CD pipelines to enforce code quality consistently.

### Type Annotations and Imports
- **Native Type Hints**: Utilize native type hints for improved readability:
  - Use `list[Type]` instead of `typing.List[Type]`
  - Use `dict[KeyType, ValueType]` instead of `typing.Dict[KeyType, ValueType]`
- **Enhanced Type Features**: Take advantage of Python 3.12's enhanced type annotation features, such as `Self` for class methods.
- **Prefer Built-ins**: Favor built-in types over their `typing` equivalents whenever possible.

### Data Validation
- **Pydantic v2 for Data Models**: Utilize [Pydantic v2](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for data modeling and validation.
- **Robust Data Models**: Create robust data models with comprehensive type annotations.
- **Custom Validators**: Implement custom validators as necessary to enforce business rules.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage Pydantic's improved performance features for efficient data handling.

### Testing
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Write thorough unit tests to ensure code correctness.
- **Testing Framework**: Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as the testing framework for its flexibility and ease of use.
- **High Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage to catch potential issues early.
- **Run Tests**: Execute tests with:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest
  ```

### Documentation
- **Clear Documentation Practices**: Use type hints and docstrings to provide clear documentation within the code.
- **Documentation Generation**: Generate project documentation using tools like [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
- **Keep Documentation Current**: Regularly update documentation to reflect code changes accurately.

### Best Practices
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guidelines for consistent coding style.
- **Clean Code Principles**: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code that is easy to understand.
- **Meaningful Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive variable and function names that convey purpose clearly.
- **Focused Functions and Methods**: Keep functions and methods focused on a single task to enhance readability and maintainability.

By following this guide, developers can create high-quality Python applications that are maintainable, scalable, and efficient while fully utilizing the capabilities of Python 3.12.
