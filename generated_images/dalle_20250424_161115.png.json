  "prompt": "Prompt:\n\nCreate an image of a highly detailed 3D figurine set featuring a pair of robbers encased in a collector's blister pack. The figurines should be life-like, with human-like facial features and realistic proportions. The first robber is male, wearing a black ski mask that reveals intense eyes and a determined expression. He is dressed in a dark leather jacket with a subtle sheen, paired with rugged jeans and black boots. His posture is dynamic, as if in mid-action, holding a small, realistic-looking handgun.\n\nThe second robber is female, with a distinct, confident expression. She is wearing a dark green tactical hoodie with the hood down, revealing short, tousled hair. Her attire includes fitted cargo pants and combat boots. In one hand, she holds a stack of detailed, miniature banknotes, and in the other, a duffel bag slung over her shoulder with visible dollar bills peeking out.\n\nThe blister pack is transparent, showcasing the figurines against a backdrop designed to resemble a bank vault. The packaging includes additional \"goodies\" like a miniature crowbar and a set of handcuffs. The design of the blister pack is sleek, with branding and text in bold, metallic fonts reminiscent of high-end collector\u2019s items.\n\nThe scene should be illuminated with soft, diffused lighting to highlight the intricate details of the figurines, such as the texture of their clothing and the realistic skin tones. The camera angle should be slightly above eye level, offering a full view of the blister pack and its contents, while focusing on the expressions and stances of the robbers. The overall aesthetic should be dark and edgy, capturing the thrilling essence of a heist scenario.",
  "revised_prompt": "Design a detailed 3D image of a collector's blister pack featuring two distinct robbers' figurines. One figurine represents a determined male with intense eyes, dressed in a dark leather jacket, rugged jeans, and black boots. He is captured mid-action, clutching a small, lifelike pistol. The other figurine is of a confident female in a dark green tactical hoodie, fitted cargo pants, and combat boots. She carries miniature banknotes in one hand and a dollar-stuffed duffel bag in the other. The transparent blister pack showcases a bank vault backdrop and extras: a tiny crowbar and handcuffs, with bold, metallic font branding. The scene should have soft, diffused lighting emphasizing the details of the figurines and their clothing. The camera angle should be slightly above eye level for a complete pack view, focusing on the figurine expressions. The overall atmosphere should be dark and edgy, encapsulating a thrilling heist scenario.",
