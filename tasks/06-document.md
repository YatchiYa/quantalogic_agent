     ```

### 4. **Improved ReAct Framework Section**
   - **Provide detailed explanations** for each part of the ReAct cycle and state diagram.
   - **Add comments** to the code snippet in `solve_task` for better understanding.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     # Generate reasoning and determine the next action
     result = self.model.generate_with_history(messages_history=self.memory.memory, prompt=current_prompt)
     ```

### 5. **Enhanced Built-in Tools Section**
   - **Include more comprehensive examples** and discuss potential use cases and limitations.
   - **Example:**
     ```markdown
     The PythonTool allows safe execution of Python scripts in isolation, ideal for data processing tasks.
     ```

### 6. **Clarified Memory Management**
   - **Provide a step-by-step explanation** of variable interpolation with a practical example.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     # Store and retrieve a variable
     key = vars.add("API Key: 12345")
     content = f"The API key is: {vars.get(key)}"
     ```

### 7. **Expanded Event System Explanation**
   - **Detail how to subscribe to and emit events** with a more elaborate example.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     # Subscribe to task completion events
     @emitter.on("task_complete")
     def on_task_complete(data):
         print(f"Task {data['task_id']} completed successfully.")
     ```

### 8. **Additional Example Workflow**
   - **Include another example** demonstrating tool chaining or task delegation.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     # Chain PythonTool and NodeJsTool
     python_result = python_tool.execute("import math; print(math.sqrt(16))")
     node_tool.execute(f"console.log('Square root of 16 is {python_result}')")
     ```

### 9. **Comprehensive Advanced Usage Guide**
   - **Provide step-by-step guides** and best practices for advanced features.
   - **Example:**
     ```markdown
     For task delegation, create specialized agents and use AgentTool to delegate specific tasks.
     ```

### 10. **Detailed Getting Started Section**
   - **Specify exact installation steps**, dependencies, and how to run the agent with an example task.
   - **Example:**
     ```markdown
     1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     2. Run the agent: `python main.py`
     3. Submit a task: `agent.solve_task("Calculate the square root of 16")`
     ```

### 11. **Summarized Conclusion**
   - **Highlight key benefits and unique features** of the QuantaLogic AI Agent.
   - **Example:**
     ```markdown
     With its modular design, extensive toolset, and efficient memory management, QuantaLogic AI Agent offers a robust solution for complex task automation.
     ```

### 12. **Visual Consistency and Formatting**
   - **Ensure consistent use of headers, code blocks, and formatting** throughout the document.
   - **Example:**
     ```markdown
     Use consistent header levels and styles for sections and sub-sections.
     ```

### 13. **FAQ Section**
   - **Add a Frequently Asked Questions section** to address common queries and troubleshooting.
   - **Example:**
     ```markdown
     **Q:** How do I install the required dependencies?
