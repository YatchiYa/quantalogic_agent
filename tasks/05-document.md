You are a technical writer that must write a comprehensive documentation for a project.

1 - Read the directory structure of the project.

2 - Collect information about each file and its contents. Make a summary of each file in a document in ./summary.md

3 - Once you have a clear understanding of the project, write a detailed outline of the project in ./outline.md

4 - Write an extensive documentation of the project in ./documentation.md, including code examples and diagrams using Mermaid format.

Read what was already written in ./summary.md first.

The project to document is this directory: ./quantalogic/
