Trading Strategy:
Okay, I will provide a hypothetical trading decision based on the structure you've outlined, but please remember that **I am missing the actual market context data**.  This is a *demonstration* of how I would analyze and respond *if* I had that data. I will assume a bullish scenario for demonstration purposes, but this is purely speculative.

**HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DECISION FOR BTC-USD**

**1. CONTEXT ANALYSIS (HYPOTHETICAL)**

*   **Key Technical Levels Identified:**
    *   Support: $60,000 (previous swing low, psychological level)
    *   Resistance: $69,000 (previous all-time high)
*   **Market Structure Assessment:**  Currently in an uptrend on the daily timeframe, with a recent pullback to a key support level. Higher lows and higher highs are still being formed.
*   **Volume Profile Analysis:**  High volume node around $60,000 suggesting strong support. Volume decreasing on the pullback.
*   **Order Flow Analysis:**  Spot buying visible near the $60,000 support level.  Aggregated limit buy orders are present near this level.
*   **Institutional Activity Analysis:**  Signs of accumulation by institutional investors near the $60,000 support level based on block trades.
*   **Risk Points Identification:**
    *   Breakdown of the $60,000 support level.
    *   Negative news regarding cryptocurrency regulation.
    *   Unexpected interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

**2. DECISION FRAMEWORK**

**A. Primary Assessment**

*   **Trading Bias:** BUY
*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75.  Justification: Uptrending market structure, confluence of support, positive order flow, and potential institutional accumulation. Risk remains due to overall market volatility and potential regulatory headwinds.
*   **Entry Type:** LIMIT. Justification: To get a potentially better price near the support level and to avoid chasing the price if it rallies aggressively.
*   **Setup Quality Score:** 0.8.  Justification:  Strong confluence of technical factors.  The main risk is broader market sentiment and potential unforeseen negative catalysts.

**B. Technical Confluence**

*   **Support/Resistance Alignment:**  Price near a key support level ($60,000) which previously acted as resistance.
*   **Order Block Validation:**  Potential bullish order block forming around the $60,000 level.
*   **Fair Value Gap Assessment:**  A fair value gap (FVG) exists above the current price, suggesting potential for price to move higher.
*   **Liquidity Level Analysis:**  Liquidity pool exists above the previous high of $69,000.
*   **Volume Structure Confirmation:**  Volume increasing as price approaches the support level, indicating potential buying pressure.

**3. TRADE PARAMETERS**

**A. Entry Strategy**

*   **Entry Price/Zone:** $60,500 (slightly above the key support to avoid being front-run).
*   **Entry Trigger Conditions:** Price touches $60,500.
*   **Technical Confirmations Required:** Bullish candlestick pattern forming on the hourly chart near the entry price.
*   **Order Flow Validations:** Increase in buying volume and positive delta at the entry price.

**B. Risk Management**

*   **Stop Loss Price:** $58,000. Justification: Below the key support level of $60,000 and below recent swing low, allowing for some volatility.
*   **Position Size:** Let's assume a $10,000 account. 2% risk is $200.  Position Size = $200 / ($60,500 - $58,000) = $200 / $2,500 = 0.08 BTC (approximately).
*   **Risk Amount:** $200 (2% of the account).
*   **Risk:Reward Ratio:** TP1: 1.5:1, TP2: 3:1, TP3: 5:1 (overall average > 2:1)

**C. Profit Targets**

*   **TP1:** $64,250 - (Previous minor resistance) - 33%
*   **TP2:** $69,000 - (Previous All-Time High) - 33%
*   **TP3:** $72,750 - (Extension of the uptrend/Fibonacci Extension) - 34%

**4. EXECUTION PLAN**

**A. Position Management**

*   **Entry Execution Method:** Place a Limit Order at $60,500.
*   **Position Scaling Rules:** Not planned initially.  Consider adding to the position if price breaks above $64,250 and retests it as support, with appropriate risk management.
*   **Stop Loss Management:** Move stop loss to breakeven once TP1 is hit. Consider trailing stop loss after TP2 is hit.
*   **Take Profit Management:** Take partial profits at each target level.

**B. Risk Factors**

*   **Technical Invalidation Points:** Breakdown of the $58,000 support level.
*   **Warning Signs to Monitor:** Increasing selling volume, bearish candlestick patterns, negative news flow.
*   **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Reduce position size if warning signs appear. Close the trade if the invalidation point is reached.
*   **Position Heat Management:** Monitor the overall cryptocurrency market and adjust position size accordingly.

**5. TRADE MONITORING**

*   **Critical Price Levels:** $60,000, $64,250, $69,000, $72,750
*   **Volume Thresholds:** Monitor volume at key levels for signs of strength or weakness.
*   **Order Flow Signals:** Watch for changes in order flow that could indicate a shift in sentiment.
*   **Technical Invalidation Points:** $58,000
*   **Risk Management Checkpoints:** Review the trade at the end of each trading day to assess performance and adjust risk parameters as needed.
