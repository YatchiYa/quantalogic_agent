Okay, I will generate a detailed trading decision based on the provided structure, but I need you to provide the MARKET CONTEXT. The error message indicates that the market context is missing or in an invalid format.  Specifically, the RSI value is causing an issue.

Once you provide the MARKET CONTEXT information, I will be able to complete the analysis and provide a detailed trading decision.  I will then follow the requested structure and provide all the necessary details.
