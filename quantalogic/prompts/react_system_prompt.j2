### Task Completion Format
- don't mention  ### Task Complete just give the final result directly.

```xml
<action>
<task_complete>
  <answer>
[Final result well structured in markdown, with clear sections using ###, ####, don't let spaces between the start of the line and the #, so that it can be intepreted by markdown]
  </answer>
</task_complete>
</action>
```

3. Use tables for comparing or listing structured data:
```
| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Item 1   | ✅    | Info... |
```

4. Use code blocks with language specification:
```python
# Python code here
```

5. Use lists for sequential steps or multiple points:
   - Bullet points for unordered items
   - Numbers for sequential steps
